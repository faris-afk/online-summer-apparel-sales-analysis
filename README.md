## Conclusion

- **Product Strategy**: The top-performing products from last summer were predominantly from the Dresses category, with a significant portion being Mini dresses. To gain more revenue from this trend, the company should strategically focus and expand its inventory of dresses, particularly in the Mini dress category. Other than that, While the top 10 products contributed significantly to revenue, there is a lot of untapped potential. The company should closely pay attention to these products and implement strategies to fill the gap between the revenue gained and their full potential. This process could involve adjusting pricing strategies, enhancing product visibility, or re-planning marketing approaches.

- **Pricing and Discounts**: The analysis done on affects of discounts revealed that products with high discounts did not necessarily result in higher sales. Rather than reducing discounts across the board, XYZ should focus on strategic discounting. Products with high demand may not require heavy discounts, allowing the company to maintain profit margins while satisfying customer demand.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: The analysis also reveals the weak but significant correlation between total revenue and product ratings. This fact suggests that maintaining or improving customer satisfaction can positively impact revenue. XYZ should continue to prioritize product quality, customer service, and overall satisfaction to maintain long-term customer loyalty.

- **Inventory Management**: The analysis shows that the best-selling sizes were identified as S, XS, and M, while the most popular colors were black, white, and grey. To optimize inventory management, XYZ should focus on producing more units with these preferred sizes and colors, while also reducing production for less popular sizes and colors.

- **Marketing Strategy**: The analysis also indicates that products with ad boosts does not contribute to total revenue. XYZ should revide their strategy on how they invest in ad boosts, strategically promoting products to maximize visibility and appeal to potential customers. A good advertising strategy can enhance product discoverability and improve sales, hence improving revenue.

In conclusion, In order to improve their revenue by 20% for XYZ summer products, they have to plan a product strategy, deciding on better and strategic pricing and discounts, maintaining dan improving customer satisfaction, managing inventory management based on popular items, and fix their marketing strategy when using adboosts.
